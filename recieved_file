This fundamental thing settled, the next point is, in what internal             Guvf shaqnzragny guvat frggyrq, gur arkg cbvag vf, va jung vagreany

First: Though most men have some vague flitting ideas of the general            Svefg: Gubhtu zbfg zra unir fbzr inthr syvggvat vqrnf bs gur trareny

One reason perhaps is, that not one in fifty of the actual disasters and        Bar ernfba creuncf vf, gung abg bar va svsgl bs gur npghny qvfnfgref naq
